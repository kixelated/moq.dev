# The First MoQ CDN: Cloudflare
🚨 It's finally happening! 🚨

Cloudflare has [just announced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moq/) their Media over QUIC CDN!
It's an **official product**, and you can test MoQ on their *massive*, anycast network.
Try it out, and convince your boss' boss that the writing is on the wall.

If you've been living under a rock, MoQ is an [up-and-coming standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/) for live media, aiming to supplant [WebRTC](/blog/replacing-webrtc), [HLS/DASH](/blog/replacing-hls-dash), and even **RTMP/SRT** as the one to rule them all.
And now Cloudflare wins the award for the first CDN offering!

</figure>

Also, *while you're here*, some shameless self-promotion: I just soft-launched [hang.live](/blog/first-app).
Check it out if you want to see the ~cringe~ cool stuff you can do with MoQ.

## What's available now?
This is a [technical preview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/moq/), so it's both free and subject to change.

Cloudflare is hosting a public `relay.cloudflare.mediaoverquic.com` endpoint that you can ~abuse~ test.
Connect using [my library](https://github.com/kixelated/moq), [Mike's fork](https://github.com/englishm/moq-rs), [Lorenzo's imquic](https://www.meetecho.com/blog/imquic/), [Meta's moxygen](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/moxygen), or any client that supports this limited subset of draft-07.

I'm biased so naturally I'm going to use [@kixelated/hang](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/js/hang) (smash that star button).
You can publish a live broadcast in the browser using the [web demo](/publish) or the [library](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/blob/main/js/hang-demo/src/publish.html#L25):

```html
<script type="module">
	// Registers the <hang-publish> element.
	import "@kixelated/hang/publish/element";
</script>

<!-- You'll need to replace `name` with something unique/random. -->
<hang-publish url="https://relay.cloudflare.mediaoverquic.com" name="unique-name-abc123" audio video controls captions>
	<!-- It's optional to provide a video element to preview the outgoing media. -->
	<video style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 auto;" muted autoplay></video>
</hang-publish>
```

There's a link to watch your live broadcast using the [web demo](/watch), or again you can use the [library](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/blob/9f5f6153458c03f255877a036e36f68f742d5c85/js/hang-demo/src/index.html#L30):
```html
<script type="module">
	// Registers the <hang-watch> element.
	import "@kixelated/hang/watch/element";
</script>

<!-- Use the same name as the broadcast you published. -->
<hang-watch url="https://relay.cloudflare.mediaoverquic.com" name="unique-name-abc123" muted controls captions>
	<!-- It's optional to provide a canvas if you want audio only -->
	<canvas style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 auto;"></canvas>
</hang-watch>
```

You might even notice **closed captions** because I've been experimenting with AI features (gotta get funding eventually 💰).
They're generated *in the browser* using [silero-vad](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) + [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) + [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index) + [onnxruntime-web](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) + [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) and transmitted using MoQ of course.
But that's a whole separate blog post; it's pretty cool.

**NOTE:** You don't have to use this [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) API.
[hang.live](/blog/first-app) uses the far more powerful Javascript API to do more complicated stuff like get access to individual video frames.
There's a *super secret* section at the end of this blog if you LOVE sample code, but I'm not going to bore the rest of you.

There's also a 🦀 Rust 🦀 library [to import MP4](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs/hang), [pipe media from ffmpeg](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/blob/9f5f6153458c03f255877a036e36f68f742d5c85/rs/justfile#L103), and [publish/watch using gstreamer](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/blob/9f5f6153458c03f255877a036e36f68f742d5c85/rs/justfile#L119) so you can do more complicated media stuff without 🤮 Javascript 🤮.
I wish I could spend more time on the Rust side but **WebSupport** is a big deal.
We are no longer forced to use WebRTC, but that also means we need to build our own WebRTC in 🤮 Javascript 🤮.
I can suffer and you can reap the rewards.

(and yes, [I'm aware that WASM exists](/blog/to-wasm), but I ended up abandoning it)

## What's not available yet?
This is a **preview** release.
Cloudflare is only supporting a *tiny* subset of an [old draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-07.html), which is even smaller than [my tiny subset](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-lcurley-moq-lite-01.html).
They're using a [fork](https://github.com/englishm/moq-rs) of my terrible code so bugs are guaranteed.

- **There's no authentication yet**: choose an unguessable name for each broadcast.
- **There's no ANNOUNCE support**: my [conferencing example](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/blob/main/js/hang-demo/src/meet.html) uses **ANNOUNCE** to discover when broadcasts start/stop, so that won't work.
- **There's no [Safari support](https://caniuse.com/webtransport)**: [It's coming eventually](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/18#issuecomment-1495890122).
- **Nothing has been optimized**: the user experience will improve over time.

If any of these are deal breakers, then you could always run your own [moq-relay](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs/moq-relay) in the meantime.
I've been adding new features and fixing a bunch of stuff *after* Cloudflare smashed that fork button.
For example, authentication (via JWT) and a WebSocket fallback for Safari/TCP support.

There's even a [terraform module](https://github.com/kixelated/moq.dev/blob/main/infra/relay.tf) that powers `relay.moq.dev`.
You too can run your own "global" CDN with 3 nodes and pay GCP a boatload of money for the privilege.
It's not *quite* as good as Cloudflare's network, currently available for free...

<figure>
	![A global CDN](/blog/first-cdn/global.png)
	<figcaption>A "global" CDN according to me, an American. At least I didn't [forget New Zealand](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapsWithoutNZ/).</figcaption>
</figure>

Or host **moq-relay** yourself!
It should even work on private networks provided you [wrestle with TLS certificates](/blog/tls-and-quic).
I'd also love to get MoQ running over [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/) for peer-to-peer action if anybody wants to help.

## Why should you care?
As a great philosopher once said:
> Apathy is a tragedy and boredom is a crime.
> \- [Bo Burnham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU)

This is a big deal.
The biggest of deals.
The HUGEST of deals.

I've been an [outspoken critic](/blog/transfork) of the MoQ standardization process.
It's just really difficult to design a protocol, via a cross-company committee, before there's been any real world usage.
It's been over 3 years since I fought Amazon lawyers and published my [first MoQ draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-lcurley-warp-00.html).
It's going to be at least another 3 years before even the [base networking layer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/) becomes an RFC.

**And that's by design!**
The best standards take a while.
Look no further than QUIC, deployed by Google in 2012, started standardization in 2015, with the RFC released in 2021.
And they had a boatload of production data to shape the specification.
Meanwhile, we have only had a [Big Buck Bunny demo](/watch), and I believe the standard has veered off course as a result.

Cloudflare has done something fantastic and said:
> fuck waiting for a RFC, let's release something

Okay they didn't say that, but this is **exactly** the mentality that MoQ needs right now.
**Just build something**.
**Just release something**.
**Just do it**.

Arguing in the [650+ issues](https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport/issues) and [500+ PRs](https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport/pulls) can wait for another day.
Tweaking the messaging encoding for the hundredth time can wait for another day.
We're still going to make sure that MoQ gets standardized *eventually*, but it's more important to get *something* out there.

I'm looking at you: Google, Akamai, Fastly, etc.
Take some code, run it on some spare servers, and start to learn what customers need *before* you design the protocol.

## What's next?
A lot of stuff.

We're effectively trying to reimplement WebRTC / HLS / RTMP using relatively new Web APIs.
Don't judge MoQ based on these initial offerings.
We've got a **ton** of work to do.
**Let's do it**.

[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr).
Somehow there's 900+ people in there.
Ping me and I will do whatever I can to help.
*Especially* if it means putting one more nail in the WebRTC coffin.

## Javascript is an Abomination
Still reading?

You win some bonus documentation.
Congrats!
I knew you would win.

Here's an example of my reactive library in action.
It powers [hang.live](/blog/first-app) so the API is subject to change and is probably already out of date.
When in doubt, [consult the source code](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/js/hang) like the hacker you are.

```typescript
import { Watch } from "@kixelated/hang"

// Start downloading a broadcast.
const watch = new Watch.Broadcast({
	enabled: true,
	url: "https://relay.cloudflare.mediaoverquic.com",
	name: "unique-name-abc123",
	video: { enabled: true },
	reload: false, // required for Cloudflare's CDN
});

// You can toggle reactive properties.
watch.audio.enabled.set(true);

// There are helpers to convert my custom signals, like for React:
import react from "@kixelated/signals/react"
const audioInfo = react(watch.audio.info); // a JSON blob of track information

// You could use the built-in renderers.
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const audio = new Watch.AudioEmitter(watch.audio, { volume: 0.5 });
const video = new Watch.VideoRenderer(watch.video, { canvas });

// Or you can do it yourself, like this crude Vanilla JS example:
const dispose = watch.video.frame.subscribe((frame?: VideoFrame) => {
	if (!frame) return;

	// Render the frame to a canvas, or pass it to a ML model, or whatever.
	canvas.getContext("2d")?.drawImage(frame, 0, 0);

	// NOTE: You should use requestAnimationFrame instead, but I'm lazy.
});
```

There's even some *top-secret* features behind undocumented APIs.
Like running an object detection model in browser and publishing the results as a MoQ track.
Stay tuned for a blog post about that if I can figure out a better use-case than a cat cam. 🐈

```typescript
// Publish a broadcast.
const publish = new Watch.Publish({
	enabled: true,
	url: "https://relay.cloudflare.mediaoverquic.com",
	name: "unique-name-abc123",
	device: "camera",
	video: {
		enabled: true,
		detection: {
			enabled: true,
		}
	},
})
```

Also, for the record, Typescript is really nice.
🤮 Javascript 🤮 is still an abomination.
