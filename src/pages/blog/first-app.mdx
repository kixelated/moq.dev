# hang.live: The First MoQ App
üö® It's finally happening! üö®

[4 months ago](./application-first) I quit my job and went all-in on MoQ.
4 months of vibe coding later (Claude Code is goated) and I've finally got something worth sharing, but by no means complete.

[hang.live](https://hang.live) is place to hang out with friends after a long day.
It's meant to be fun and stupid.
Everything is **live** and revolves around human interfaction.
People will *eventually* need a break from AI slop, even if that means disqualifying myself from VC funding.

And of course, all of the functionality (except for user accounts) uses Media over QUIC.
I wanted to demonstate what's now possible within the browser, utilizing WebTransport, WebCodecs, WebAudio, WebGPU, WebAssembly, WebWorkers, WebEtc.
Basically every web feature under the sun *except for WebRTC*.

If any of that sounds cool, check out my [Replacing WebRTC](./replacing-webrtc) post.

## Open Source
Even if you don't want to use a site designed for cringe teenagers, there's much to be excited about.

The core networking and media stuff is [open source](https://github.com/kixelated/moq), written in **Rust** and **Typescript**.
I've been polishing the core libraries for a few years now, so they're actually pretty good.
Even the [crude CDN](https://github.com/kixelated/moq.dev/tree/main/infra) is open source if you feel like paying GCP a bucket of money every month.

There's already a few companies using my awful code, like [Cloudflare](./first-cdn) and terrifying enough, a few defense contractors.
I am eager to help if you want to grow that list.
[Join the MoQ Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr) and ping `@kixelated`.

The vibe coded UI is closed source for now.
I still have ambitions of [hang.live](https://hang.live) taking off and want to make it a *tiiiny* bit more difficult to clone.
And you should probably make something more professional anyway.

## Features
Too busy and/or awkward to invite a friend and try it out?
Me too.

- üé• **The usual stuff**: microphone, webcam, screen sharing.
- ‚ö° **Synchronized drag/drop/zoom**: No more boring, static grids.
- ü§ñ **Automatic captions**: Generated using AI, [running in the browser](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index).
- üëÄ **Previews**: See who is talking before awkwardly joining.
- üí¨ **TTS Announcements**: No need to alt-tab, just listen to who has joined. Also AI.
- üìù **Live chat**: Super simple text tracks, using markdown.
- ‚≠ê **Favorites**: Favorite a hang so you can preview a bunch at the same time.
- üòÇ **Memes**: An assortment of meme videos and sounds; try `/brb`.

## Huge Disclaimer
This shit is hard.
Nothing has been optimized and the user experience still leave much to be desired.
Just like the [Cloudflare CDN](./first-cdn), consider this as a demo of what is possible and NOT the end state.

WebRTC has had the luxury of being integrated into the browser and being bankrolled by Google for over a decade.
It's really good at powering Google Meet, but it gets exponentially more difficult as you stray from the happy path.
It's why all conferencing apps feel the same, and I want to change that.

The current focus is to demonstrate what's possible and polish it later.
And I've tested Firefox about as many times as I've worn a suit.
Don't be that WebRTC fanboy who quips about how it doesn't work or how unoptimized it is.

## The Future
I've given myself at least 1 year to work on this before I'll consider getting a real job‚Ñ¢.
You can help me delay the inevitable by sharing [hang.live](https://hang.live).
Who knows, it might turn into a real job.

Until then, here's my current plan:
- **Safari Support**: Working on a WebSocket fallback for the Apple fanboys.
- **File sharing**: Stream an image or video to the hang.
- **Notifications**: Get notified when someone joins a favorite.
- **Desktop and Mobile App**: Probably using [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/).
- **Chat History**: The app currently has the memory of a goldfish.
- **Discord Bot**: Gotta steal the users somehow.
- **More AI Stuff**: Gotta get funding somehow.

I'm totally open to suggestions and contributions.
