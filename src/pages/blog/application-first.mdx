# Application First
Today was my last day at Discord.
It's a great company with a great product and great people.
If you're an A/V engineer in SF, [take my job](https://discord.com/jobs/7953473002) and make me proud.

My brain says I'm making a mistake, but my heart wants to kamikaze into the sun.
It's time to double down on this passion project.

**tl;dr**
- I'm making a startup to progress Media over QUIC.
- Any generic components will be open-source.
- It's going to be sick.

## Media over QUIC
But before I explain more, I have to bore you with some history.

I've been working on Media over QUIC for a long time.
My fateful project to reduce latency at Twitch was over 5 years ago (!).
We tried using WebRTC, but it just kind of sucked; it wasn't designed for our use case.
I eventually stumbled upon QUIC/WebTransport and [pivoted once more](https://quic.video/blog/distribution-at-twitch).

I built something called Warp as a LL-HLS replacement for Twitch and it was pretty good.
We needed more browser support and somehow had to convince Apple this was worth adding to Safari.
So I got permission to release it as an [IETF draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-lcurley-warp-00.html) despite knowing nothing about standards bodies.
And when I say "permission", I mean we needed to get Twitch lawyers to fight against Amazon lawyers to participate in the IETF and strike down a provincial patent filed without my knowledge.
**FUN TIMES WERE HAD.**

Unfortunately, priorities at Twitch changed and Warp was only briefly in production for 10% of Chrome users.
Amazon finally noticed that we were losing a ton of money and the post-Covid downsizing began.
But hey, I got severance and used it to build this crude [quic.video](https://quic.video) website while in a coffee shop in Tokyo.
I'm back in San Francisco now; a huge downgrade.

## Standardization
It turned out that the Warp draft struck a chord within IETF.
[Meta](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kpugin-rush-03.html) and [Cisco](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jennings-mimi-quicr-proto-00.html) had both published similar drafts.
All I had to do was [combine our drafts](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-lcurley-warp-04.html) and boom, we'd have the start of a new standard.
The [Media over QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/) working group was born.
It's apparently the most active working group [with a variety of drafts](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/documents/) aiming to shake up the industry.

However.
HOWEVER.
[I decided this was not the most productive path](https://quic.video/blog/transfork).
I stopped my involvement, and I'm no longer listed as an author on the [latest moq-transport draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-11.html).
It would have been cool to put *author of RFC9876* on my resume.
Oh well.

Trying to standardize an experimental protocol is just a huge time sink.
Arguing with multiple people from a big established company (__*cough*__ Cisco __*cough*__) was a nightmare.
I was going nowhere in a hurry.

I decided it would be better to join an existing company, like **Discord**, and see if I couldn't replace WebRTC from within.
I'm kind of a gamer and have always wanted to work at Discord.
My BBF had just become the boss of the A/V team and I was like "I'm in".

Well that failed.
I did some neat things at Discord, like rewriting the WebRTC SFU in Rust.
But my primary passion is MoQ and it just didn't make any product sense.

- Why would you rewrite your established A/V stack for nearly zero new features?
- Why not fork WebRTC (even more) instead?
- Who cares about a "simpler" protocol when everything already "works"?

Discord is prioritizing the right projects and making incremental improvements.
I can't disagree with any of the decisions and priorities.
Like I said, it's a great company and I hope one day they'll end up using MoQ.

But I can't keep working on WebRTC.
There's just too many things that I wish I could improve but I'm forced to maintain compatibility with `libwebrtc` for browser support.
It's a (lucrative) dead end.

## Strengths First
I'm guilty of advocating for new tech just for the sake of it.
It's how you push boundaries.
But it's also how you pivot in a circle.
And boy do I love rewriting stuff.

It might sound obvious, but you need to figure out what a new technology is good at *before* you use it.
It could be significantly faster, or have significantly more features, or be significantly cheaper.
But it has to have *something*.
Otherwise you're just migrating to the nextest Javacript framework and irritating every coworker in a 5-mile radius.

So what is Media over QUIC good at?
Well, the story around CDN support is great, which is why so many CDN companies are actively participating and building prototypes.
Google, Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, etc.

But what real *product* use cases does it solve?
Why would you use it over WebRTC or HLS/DASH or SRT or RTMP or TeamSpeak?
Don't get me wrong, CDN support is great, but I'm not going to rebuild my entire media stack for that, nor would it be cheaper than existing HTTP and WebRTC CDNs.
I need something users care about.

That's where the standardization effort falls short.
The working group is focused on dumb shit like reinventing HTTP/1.1 pipelining via [FETCH](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-11.html#name-fetch).
The motivation is to support VOD, which is noble, but it's something HLS/DASH (via HTTP) already does very well.
There's no point reinventing the [\<video\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video) tag.

I'm guilty of this too.
Literally click on the [Watch](/watch) button in the navigation bar and you'll see a reinvented [\<video\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video) tag.
It doesn't even work properly and I haven't fixed it because the demo is so underwhelming.

Here's how we break out of this rut.

## Application First
I'm making a startup so I *have* to focus on the product.

I'm not collecting a paycheck or any venture capital.
This has to be a good usage of Media over QUIC or I don't get paid.
I mean, it's not like my family is going to starve if I decide to rewrite the transport layer *again*, but you get the idea.

Using Media over QUIC is a selfish requirement because I'm in too deep.
I've got too much personal legacy tied up in the project to walk away and join some AI startup.
It's not how you're supposed to build a startup but I think I have the expertise and passion to make it work.

So what sort of product can we build on top of MoQ?
What strengths does it have that we can exploit?

The main advantage of Media over QUIC is that you can break out of the WebRTC jail.
Suddenly, you can implement features that Google Meet doesn't care about... hence why they're not in WebRTC.
Web is the primary focus (not native) because it's the bottleneck.

And I believe the game-changing features are on the front-end.
Utilize WebCodecs, WebGPU, WebAudio, WebTransport, etc to build something isn't possible on yesterday's browser.
Make something slick, gimmicky, and hope it catches on.
And cringe.
Super cringe, something that a serious company would never touch.

It's a little disappointing because I primarily enjoy Rust and backend services.
But it's time to swallow my pride and double down on the front-end via **Typescript**.
This demo currently uses [Rust+WASM](https://quic.video/blog/to-wasm) but it's time to hit the revert button.
Oops.


## Open Source Second
I don't want to build this alone.
I love open source and want to release all my code so you can profit.
Use my code to pilot drones or stream sports or watch security cameras; I don't care.
And contribute maybe?

But **Application First** means that I'm also not going to focus on building a library.
If your goal is to make a generic library, then you end up making a generic application.
I've built too many demos expecting something else to turn them into an application.

If a component is naturally generic, then it'll be open-sourced.
If WebRTC supports it, then it'll be open-sourced.
And if the application bombs, then I'll release everything, of course

But I want to keep some of the cringe and flashy UI effects close to the chest.
They're not that reusable and I want to have an exit strategy...

## Standards Last
I love the IETF as an organization.
It's a great place to meet people, collaborate, and engage in spicy drama/politics behind the scenes.
And I'd like to show up to some of the meetings and keep the momentum going.

But I can't spend more time arguing about [VarInt encoding](https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport/issues/549).
Or if sequence numbers should be sequential or monotonically increasing.
Or bikeshedding names.
I'm just going to call it `PeePeePooPoo` and move on.

The people who create standards and chair working groups are saints.
I don't have that sort of patience.
I think the most productive thing I can do is to build something and show it off.
Build an application and use it to guide the standard, not the other way around.

To that end, I'm only going to implement what my application will use.
I'll eventually hit the publish button on something called `moq-lite` that is just the *bare minimum* to get the job done.
Even the good ideas (some that I'm proud of) will be left out and added only when actually implemented.

## It's Going to be Sick
Look I would be lying if I didn't have some doubts.
I can't predict where I'll be 1 year from now and that's pretty exciting.

I've got a lot of ideas and a domain.
If it doesn't work out, then hopefully **YOU** can use some of the code and upcoming blog posts.
I promise they're a LOT funnier than this one.

Join [the Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr) for updates.
Reach out to `@kixelated` especially if you live in SF and want to jam.
I'm down to scheme too if any companies have a partnership in mind.

Hoping to have a public demo in 3-6 months.
