# Monte\<video\>: A Real Place
Who knew?

No like seriously, they named a place after video encoding.
And it's the capital of Uruguay???

## Summer Camp
🎉 [kixelated/moq](https://github.com/kixelated/moq) was selected for the 2026 [Montevideo Tech Summer Camp](https://montevideotech.dev/summercamp2026/). 🎉

This means that Mike (Cloudflare) and I (painfully unemployed) will be "mentoring" open source contributors over the next few months.
It starts as a weekly online meeting before eventually culminating in an (optional) event in Montevideo at the end of January.
AND it's summer there while it's cold (mostly) everywhere else.

## Should you participate?
So I actually went to Uruguay last year when they picked [Mike's fork](https://github.com/video-dev/moq-js) of my JS library.

Yes it was super awkward contributing to a fork of my own project.
Yes I'm just an awkward person in general.
But it was still fun, I recommend it, and I'll be heading there again this year.

If you want an excuse to work on MoQ or a business justification to visit Uruguay, this is your chance.
The Qualabs folks legitimately turn it into a full-blown vacation with organized events, tours, meals, etc.
You don't actually spend much time doing work, you mostly hang out with other video nerds instead.


## What are we working on?
But before the event, we'll be working on MoQ.
I'll be filing a boatload of issues in the next few days in a vain attempt at project planning.
If you have any ideas or feature requests, file an issue or ping me on Discord.

Here's some of my big ideas if anything sounds interesting:

### Conferencing
Steal the rendering engine from [hang.live](/blog/first-app) and make a general purpose conferencing app.
Without the copious amount of cringe and meme videos.
Throw in some lame corporate branding and you've got a legitimate product..?

### MoQ+HLS+DASH
One of the biggest barriers to adoption is getting MoQ to work with an existing HLS/DASH stack.
It's not viable to instantaneously migrate all clients to MoQ, despite the IETF pretending like a FETCH verb is all you need.
I want to scope out what it takes to simultaneously support MoQ, HLS, and DASH with a single implementation

### OBS and Friends
Another barrier to adoption is getting the media in the first place.
I've got a crude gstreamer plugin already but we can make it better.
Being able to ingest media from OBS would be a HUGE milestone.

### POLISH
We can also just polish the MoQ player and make it (more) ready for production.
Stuff like better bundling, better documentation, better examples, etc.


## What next?
The kick-off meeting is [this Friday](https://meetu.ps/e/PF7F0/GFW4z/i) and it'll be a recurring thing until the end of January.
I'm going to be in Australia for the next few months so 3am is going to be rough, but sacrifice is part of my "job description".

- If you're interested in the in-person event, [email to get on the guest list](mailto:summercamp@montevideotech.dev). You have to pay for flights+hotel, but it's worth it.
- If you're not interested in the in-person event but want to contribute, join the meetings to coordinate?

Or just hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr).
Direct social interaction is overrated.
I'll make a `#montevideo` channel or something.

## One Last Thing
I want to thank JP, Nico, and the rest of [Qualabs](https://qualabs.com/) for being great hosts.

It's fantastic that they sponsor their employees to contribute to open source projects for a few months.
It's even more fantastic that they sponsor parties and events for video nerds.

I had a blast last year and hopefully I'll see you there this year.
