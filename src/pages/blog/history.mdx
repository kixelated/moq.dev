## Ancient History 
Humor grandpa for a moment and let me tell you a story.

5 years ago (!) I was tasked with reducing latency on Twitch by utilizing WebRTC.
The research project meandered, pivoting tech stacks multiple times as new problems reared their ugly head.
We went from libwebrtc, to Pion, to an optimized rewrite of Pion, to using data-channels only, to hacking data-channels for "datagram" support so we could abstract away WebRTC.

But datagram support alone is meaningless; we needed some features on top like retransmissions.
One fateful day I decided to create a spreadsheet of existing video/networking protocols and their features.
Spreadsheets are lame but this one was awesome, with color coding for pros/cons and shit.
It's when I realized that SRT is terrible (over the Internet) and there wasn't anything real exciting on the horizon.

But then I discovered QUIC and HTTP/3.
QUIC is amazing and cool and does some really smart things.
But browsers only exposed QUIC via HTTP/3, and the HTTP semantics make real-time a little bit challenging.
Ideally we could push new frames without utilizing the web's longest living hack: long-polling.

I think I Googled "WebSockets but for QUIC" and found WebTransport.
And sure enough there was a brand new Chrome origin trial released two weeks prior.
I requested an access token to use WebTransport on `*.twitch.tv`  and I wasn't aware of any other companies doing the same.
It was bleeding edge stuff, we're talking 100% CPU usage on the network thread because of a bug in the event loop.
I whipped together a prototype and sure enough, we had pivoted once more.

The majority of Twitch viewers use Chrome and we could embed a QUIC with our native apps.
However one risk remained: Safari.
Apple was already an early adopter of HTTP/3 but we needed to ensure this new tech made it into browsers.
We couldn't ditch HLS until some combination of MSE (for iOS), WebCodecs, and WebTransport was available in Safari.

So I got permission to release our Media over QUIC protocol called Warp.
We published a draft via the IETF, a fantastic and open standards organization responsible for every* networking protocol: QUIC, HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.
And crucially an organization with active Apple participants who might like the ideas and prioritize browser support.
Cynically, that's the purpose of standards organizations.
You're there to convince others to support your thing so you can benefit somehow.
