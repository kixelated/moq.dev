**Media over QUIC** is a live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement that powers [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) and your _favorite_ big tech companies such as Google, Meta, Cisco, Akamai, etc.

That's right, soon you will never have to deal with WebRTC again.

**NOTE**: This website uses a [fork](/blog/transfork) of the IETF drafts called [moq-lite](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs/moq) and [hang](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs/hang).
The principles and rationale behind MoQ are great, but progress is painfully slow as it's an experimental protocol designed by committee.
My goal is to build something *now* so you can use it.
