**Media over QUIC** is a live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement that powers [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)\* and your _favorite_ big tech companies such as Google, Meta, Cisco, Akamai, Cloudflare, etc.

That's right, *soon* you will never have to deal with WebRTC again.
Unless masochism is your thing.

### *Standards
This website uses a [fork](/blog/transfork) of the IETF draft called [moq-lite](https://kixelated.github.io/moq-drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-lite.html) and a media layer called [hang](https://kixelated.github.io/moq-drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-hang.html).
The principles behind MoQ are fantastic, but standards are **SLOW** and involve too much arguing.
My goal is to build something simple that you can use *now*, even if it's not a standard *yet*.


### Learn More
Check out the [blog](/blog) for more information and a smattering of jokes.
Once you're ready for more, check out the [Github](https://github.com/kixelated/moq) and/or join [Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr).


Contributions are welcome, of course.
But also feel free to just yoink the code, fork it, and make it your own.
If you're using some flavor of MoQ in the wild, I'd love to hear about it!
My DMs are always open; `@kixelated` on Discord.
