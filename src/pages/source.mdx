# Open Source

Everything is open source and broken into two repositories:

- [kixelated/moq](https://github.com/kixelated/moq): The core MoQ library, with implementations in Rust and Typescript.
- [kixelated/quic.video](https://github.com/kixelated/quic.video): This website. Includes terraform to run multiple relays on GCP.

## Rust
Native code is written in [Rust](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs) and is split into a few notable crates:

|                                                                               crate | description                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                [moq-lite](https://docs.rs/moq-lite/latest/moq_lite/) | A generic pub/sub transport. This is a minimal reinterpretation of the IETF [MoqTransport draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/).  |
|                [moq-relay](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs/moq-relay) | A Moq server that connects publishers to subscribers, caching and deduplicating any subscriptions. Note that MoQ does not support P2P; instead it utilizes relays to scale out to many subscribers.                                                            |
|                [moq-clock](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/rs/moq-clock) | It's a clock! Just to demonstrate that MoQ can be used for more than media.                                                                            |
|                    [hang](https://docs.rs/hang/latest/hang/) | A media specific library built on top of moq-lite. This provides a JSON "catalog" that describes the media tracks and "container" that literally consists of a timestamp. The actual media decoding/encoding is left to the platform. |
|                    [hang-cli](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/hang-cli) | A client that integrates with ffmpeg to publish media. This pipes fMP4 over stdin, so it's not the most efficient...                                                                                             |
|                    [hang-gst](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/hang-gst) | A gstreamer plugin for publishing and consuming media. It works, but needs a lot of polish. |
|                    [hang-wasm](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/hang-wasm) | An MoQ web client utilizing WebAssembly, WebCodecs, and WebTransport. Deprecated in favor of the Typescript implementation; see below for justification. |


There are some additional crates in other repositories that might be of interest:
| crate | description |
| ----: | ----------- |
| [web-transport-quinn](https://docs.rs/web-transport-quinn/latest/web_transport_quinn/) | A [WebTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3/) client and server utilizing [Quinn](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn). Copies the Quinn API and abstracts away the HTTP/3 handshake.  |
| [web-transport-wasm](https://github.com/kixelated/web-transport-rs/tree/main/web-transport-wasm) | A WASM [WebTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3/) wrapper around the `web-sys` bindings. |
| [web-transport](https://github.com/kixelated/web-transport-rs) | A common (opinionated) interface, utilizing one of the above depending on the platform. This is what the `moq-lite` crate uses. |
| [web-codecs](https://docs.rs/web-codecs/latest/web_codecs/) | A wrapper around the [WebCodecs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) for WASM. |
| [web-streams](https://docs.rs/web-streams/latest/web_streams/) | A wrapper around the [Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) for WASM. |


## Typescript
Web code is written in [Typescript](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/js) and is split into a few packages:

| package | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [@kixelated/moq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kixelated/moq) | A moq-lite client that mirrors the Rust API. You can publish and subscribe to generic tracks. Any media stuff is implemented at a higher layer. |
| [@kixelated/hang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kixelated/hang) | A media library. This is where the bulk of the cool stuff happens, like capturing/encoding or decoding/rendering media. Includes Web Components to make setup super simple. [See the demos](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/js/hang/demo). |

**Note**: These utilize browser-specific APIs and there's no currently no support for Node and other server runtimes.
[Deno](https://deno.com/) is doing some cool stuff with WebTransport so maybe it'll work there someday.

And before you ask, yes, it is possible to use WASM for web support as demonstrated by the [hang-wasm](https://github.com/kixelated/moq/tree/main/hang-wasm) crate.
However, it involves a lot of boilerplate, wrappers, and casting.
The performance is not great because the WASM sandbox doesn't have networking or device access, requiring copying and/or message passing to use Web APIs.

So, we migrated all web code (back) to Typescript.
It makes me a sad crab, but it results in faster iteration and the best user experience.
