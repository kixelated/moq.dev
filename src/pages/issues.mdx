# Issues

Yeah, so there's a lot of work to do.

Because we've broken out of the WebRTC jail, we need to implement a lot of things that are taken for granted.
If you want full control over the media stack so you can build cool shit, then welcome, you're in the right place.
But if you just want a Google Meet clone and want to do minimal work, then check out [Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc).

This page is a summary of the major issues, updated periodically.

## What works
Before we give into despair, here's what does work:

- **Browsers**: Chrome and soon Firefox. We're bleeding on the edge.
- **Audio**: OPUS, AAC
- **Video**: VP8, VP9, H.264, H.265, AV1
- **Catalog**: A live-updating JSON blob that describes the available tracks.
- **Clustering**: Multiple relays form a basic mesh network, providing CDN-like performance.
- **Subscriptions**: Nothing flows over the network until needed. ex. no audio while muted
- **Integrations**: Gstreamer and ffmpeg (publishing only).

Now on to the issues.

## Networking

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safari Support     | No Safari support for WebTransport. Webkit has expressed [public support](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/18#issuecomment-1495890122) so it will likely show up one day. Until then, perhaps we should support WebSockets as a fallback. [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webtransport) |
| Prioritization | Media should be prioritized by the sender during congestion via [priority hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportsendstreamoptions-sendorder) when implemented. ex. *new audio > old video*. This should be implemented in Chrome but has yet to be hooked up and tested. |
| Congestion Control | The default congestion controller in QUIC (Reno/CUBIC) suffers from [bufferbloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat). The WebTransport API exposes [congestion control hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransport-congestioncontrol) but I'm not sure if this has been implemented in browsers yet. It's also not clear if BBR is sufficient for real-time media and we might want to invest in porting GCC (Google Congestion Control) to QUIC. |
| Authentication | There's no authentication in `moq-relay` (outside of TLS). Anybody can publish or subscribe to broadcasts with any name. We need to implement a token given to clients that scope what they can do. |
| Clustering | The relays form a very simple mesh network, where each relay talks to every other relay. This won't scale past a few nodes; we need some sort of tree. |


## Media

| name                      | description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adaptive Bitrate  	| Currently, the bitrate for a broadcast is fixed at creation time. We need to implement back-pressure so the broadcaster lowers its bitrate during congestion. In addition, we could use simulcast to create multiple tracks allowing the viewer to choose what to receive. |
| Echo Cancellation | People who use speakers are the worst. But seriously, we need some form of echo cancelation otherwise conferencing is difficult. It seems like you can specify it [when capturing media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints/echoCancellation) but I've yet to test how well it works. |
| OBS Plugin      | We should develop an [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) plugin to make it easier to publish broadcasts. The gstreamer plugin should also be improved but it mostly works. |
| Viewer Feedback | Currently, viewers don't provide any feedback to the broadcaster(s). This would be very useful for small broadcasts for stuff like negotiating codecs, bitrates, etc. |


## Miscellaneous

| name                      | description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logging | There's no logging, metrics, or even health checks. I don't even know if the site is up. |
| Chat | I want to implement a chat protocol over MoQ! |

And of course, there's a million other things.
